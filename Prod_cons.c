 * This program demonstrates a simple producer-consumer problem solution using pthreads with proper synchronization to avoid race conditions. 
 * The producer and consumer run indefinitely, producing and consuming items from the shared buffer.
 * cond_producer is a condition variable to signal the producer when there is space in the buffer. cond_consumer is a condition variable to signal the consumer when there are items in the buffer.
 * Produces items and adds them to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it waits for the consumer to consume an item. Signals the consumer whenever it adds a new item to the buffer.
 * Consumes items from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, it waits for the producer to produce an item. Signals the producer whenever it consumes an item from the buffer
